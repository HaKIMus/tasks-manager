# Project Idea: Task Manager API

## Overview:
Create a RESTful API for a simple task management system. Users should be able to create accounts, log in, and manage their to-do lists.

## Features:
* User Authentication: Use Symfony's security component to handle user registration and JWT-based authentication.
* CRUD Operations: Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete tasks.
* Categories: Allow users to categorize tasks. A task can belong to one category.
* Due Dates: Allow setting due dates for tasks.
* Search and Filter: Allow tasks to be searched by title or filtered by their status (completed, pending, etc.) or due dates.
* Pagination: Implement pagination for listing tasks.
* Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on your API to protect against abuse.
* Technologies:
* Symfony 6 for the backend
* Doctrine ORM for database interactions
* MySQL as the database
* PHPUnit for testing

## Steps:
* Set Up: Initialize a new Symfony project and set up a MySQL database.
* User Model: Create a User entity and use Symfonyâ€™s built-in features for password hashing.
* Task and Category Models: Create Task and Category entities. Make sure tasks are related to users and categories.
* API Endpoints: Implement RESTful API endpoints for all CRUD operations.
* Authentication: Implement JWT-based authentication.
* Rate Limiting: Use Symfony's rate limiter component.
* Testing: Write PHPUnit tests for the various features.
* Documentation: Document how to set up and use your API. You could use tools like Swagger.

## Bonus:
* Docker: Create a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for easy setup.
* Continuous Integration: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions.
* What this demonstrates:
* Mastery of Symfony and PHP
* API design skills
* Understanding of RESTful services
* Database schema design
* Authentication and security
* Rate limiting
* Unit testing
* Documentation skills
* Completing this project will give you a lot to talk about during job interviews, from your choice of architecture and technologies to the challenges you faced and how you solved them. It's also a practical demonstration of your skills that can complement the theoretical knowledge you might be asked about.
